fhir_capability_statement(
  url = "https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4",
  username = NULL,
  password = NULL,
  sep = " ",
  remove_empty_columns = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The base URL of the FHIR server.}

\item{username}{A string containing the username for basic authentication. Defaults to NULL, meaning no authentication.}

\item{password}{A string containing the password for basic authentication. Defaults to NULL, meaning no authentication.}

\item{sep}{A string to separate pasted multiple entries}

\item{remove_empty_columns}{Logical scalar. Remove empty columns?}

\item{brackets}{A character vector of length two defining the brackets surrounding indices for multiple entries, e.g. \code{c( "<", ">")}.
If \code{NULL}, no indices will be added to multiple entries. \code{NULL} means \code{brackets} is looked up in design, if it is \code{NULL} there too, no indices are added.}

\item{verbose}{An integer Scalar.  If 0, nothings is printed, if 1, only finishing message is printed, if > 1,
downloading/extraction progress will be printed. Defaults to 2.}

\item{add_indices}{Deprecated. This argument was used to control adding of indices for multiple entries. This is now
done via the brackets argument. If brackets is \code{NULL}, no indices are added, if brackets is not \code{NULL}, indices are added to multiple entries.}
